# Technical-Documentation-Page

This is an example of a technical documentation page that I have created from scratch

I used video game history simply as a filler

The sources I used for this page are: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_video_games and https://www.stash.com/learn/defining-moments-in-video-game-history-a-timeline/

All of the content on this page was taken from someone else, the purpose of this page is strictly to showcase how far my skills have developed with HTML and CSS after two weeks of practice.

This page is technically only half finished. My main goal was to create the structure and format for this page so I could prove that I could add virtually any content to this page and have it work.
